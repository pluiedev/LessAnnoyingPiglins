# LessAnnoyingPiglins
a very very simple fabric mod that makes piglin neutral for a set time (defaults to 15s) after bartering.  
inspired by the countless innocent deaths of players caused by crossbow-wielding quick-acting piglins.
you're welcome.

### how 2 use
install fabric, move jar into mods directory, run. easy peasy. no fabric api required.

### adjust for ur own use
@ \<root folder\>/config/lessannoyingpiglins.toml.
should be pretty obvious (i mean theres only one line. cmon)  
or you can just use the config screen provided by mod menu.

### can i use it
sure  
(an attribution would **certainly** be welcomed)
